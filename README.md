# Instructions
Asteroids are heading for Earth! Use the Planet Protectors space towers to destroy them. Beat wave 15 to win!

Use the "Left Mouse Button" to place the towers in the squares prvoided.
Each tower only has enough battery for 15 shots before they die and float away.
Each tower can only take 3 hits from asteroids before they are destroyed.

## Reflection
This iteration was fun to work on. The game has been coming together just like we want and we are excited to be able to add more of our ideas to the game. Our planning stage was rough, because we didn’t really understand how small to slice our problems. We were thinking too big like “Add level” rather than “Add Collision between Asteroid and Tower”. We plan to put more into the planning stage for this next iteration to make sure our slicing and user stories are right. We did our own sprites as Ethan feels the game doesn’t feel right using mixed and matched sprites from the internet.They turned out well and make the game feel like ours. We were going to have an exception, for the asteroid sprite, but Logan emailed for guidance and we decided to just make one. Which fit better with Ethan’s values. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but it feels good having this iteration as a starting point to work from.
