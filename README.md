## Reflection
This iteration ended up being a lot more fun than the second iteration. This is due to the fact we were able to add a lot more features we thought were cool rather than doing behind the scene stuff. Logan's personal favorite feature added is the missle. Ethan's favorite thing added was the improved win screen. Who doesn't love fireworks? Ethan did an amazing job creating the sprites and animation for it. He did have quite the trouble making it look like it was spinning, but is happy with how it turned out. Logan enjoyed figuring out how to program its area of effect feature. The one thing that Logan did not quite enjoy and has learned a lot from is trying to figure out balancing. While the game is now playable and can be won, he is not completely happy with the balancing and would improve on it in a future hypothetical iteration. Also in this hypothetical 4th iteration we would add smooth transitions between all scene changes, more towers, and other minor polishing we missed in this iteration.
